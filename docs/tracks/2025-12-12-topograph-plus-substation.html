        <h2>Notes</h2>

<p>This is my most ambitious attempt so far to make "a song" with VCV Rack Pro.
I started with the drum sounds, first exploring and then abandoning a couple
of modules that contain (presumably) samples of various drum sounds in favor 
of synthesizing them from scratch. That ended up being a pretty fun and rewarding
approach, and maybe aside from the "hi hat" sound that ended up more like a 
wood block or something, I think the drums sound pretty decent. </p>

<p>I used a great module from Valley Audio called <a href="https://valleyaudio.github.io/rack/topograph/">Topograph</a>
to generate the sequences. It's a clone of Mutable Instruments HW module called 
"Grids" that allows you to navigate through an X-Y "coordinate system" of drum
sequences while adjusting the density of triggers for each of three voices and
adding some randomness via a "Chaos" knob. I used the Impromptu <a href="https://marcboule.github.io/ImpromptuModular/#tact">Tact</a>
controllers to controller X/Y/Chaos; those have a Rate parameter that will transition
gradually between values. That ended up being a good approach for slowly evolving 
the drum sequence and short-circuiting my tendency to overthink everything and 
force it into a strict grid (which always makes everything end up having a simple
pop song structure when I try it.)</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://slimechildaudio.com/substation/manual/">Substation</a> modules from
Slime Child Audio again for the synth. It's really fun and sounds great. I think I
know what it's capable of now, and I'll probably branch out and try something different
next time.</p>

<p>I went down a long rabbit hole trying to automate the parameters for the VCV Rack patches
in Ableton. I eventually figured out (with Claude's help) how to assign them via "macros"
in Live, which basically makes any module parameter available for automation, but I kept
running into the same old problems... too much fussiness, too much focus on repetition 
and structure, not enough creativity and not enough fun. I ended up just improvising
a simple composition by twiddling knobs in various windows. It was a useful learning 
experience, though, and I'll keep trying to figure out a compositional process that
works for me inside Ableton.</p>
