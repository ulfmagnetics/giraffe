        <h2>Notes</h2>

<p>I've been working on getting my old home studio back in operation.
I haven't made much music in three or four years, and most of this stuff
was gathering dust in various corners of my office. But it seems like 
the biggest barriers here were mental, in not having everything easily
available in once relatively confined space. Once I bought the two-tier
keyboard stand (Ultimate Support AX-48 Pro) everything seemed to click. 
I loaded it up with my Prophet 600, cut some plywood into a relatively
stable shelf for the second tier, and bought an 8-channel ADAT mixer 
for the old equipment rack I bought about ten years ago. With eight
extra channels available to send into my Apollo Twin X via ADAT, I can
now send four channels from the 707 (kick, snare, hat, rim or other perc)
into my mix, with three channels for synths and one more for an effects
loop. </p>

<p>This track is sort of a demo of everything working together, recorded via
Live with a template set that I've been incrementaly improving over recent
days. The goal is to have something that's ready to go whenever inspiration
strikes. We've got the Moduleur going through a weird "bucket brigade" delay
pedal that I built like 20 years ago as a guitar pedal, plus the Prophet and
the 707.</p>
